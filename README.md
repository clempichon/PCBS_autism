# Machine learning on autism data

## Introduction 

 Pr Fadi Fayez Thabtah, from the Digital Technology Departement of Manukau Institute of Technology of Auckland has created an app, the Autism Spectrum Disorder Tests App, aiming at understanding the main characteristics of autistic patients in order to better detect ASD. By answering a series of 10 questions, and giving a few information about themselves, users of the app have contributed in creating datasets related to autism. It has been divided in three parts : children (from 4 to 11 years old), adolescents (12 to 18 years old), and adults. 

These datasets are the starting for this project of machine learning, aiming at creating an algorithm that detect autism from the responses to those 10 questions.
